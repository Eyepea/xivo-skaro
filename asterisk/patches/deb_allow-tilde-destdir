Subject: relax badshell tilde test
Author: Faidon Liambotis <paravoid@debian.org>
Bug: http://issues.asterisk.org/view.php?id=14718
Last-Update: 2009-12-19

badshell is disallowing tildes (~) in the DESTDIR directory to warn people
who use a shell that doesn't expand it to $HOMEDIR.

However, we have such a tilde in our directory (~dfsg) that isn't expanded
to $HOMEDIR nor shouldn't be.

This patch relaxes this test just for cases where the ~ is followed by a '/',
which should catch most cases.
