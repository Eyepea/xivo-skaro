# User defined DAHDI system.conf configuration file
#
# dahdi config is normally done through the web-interface
# but you have the possibility to override its configuration and replace it
# by the following

# bloc header MUST be the span number
# bloc content is inserted as raw in generated system.conf configuration file

# i.e:
# sample config for E1 spanÂ #1
#[1]
#span=2,2,0,ccs,hdb3,crc4
#bchan=32-46,48-62
#dchan=47
#echocanceller=oslec,32-46,48-62

# sample config for BRI span #2
#[2]
#span=2,0,0,ccs,ami
#bchan=4-5
#hardhdlc=6
#echocanceller=mg2,4-5


# global bloc (replace the one generated from web-interface)
#[global]
#loadzone=en
#defaultzone=en
