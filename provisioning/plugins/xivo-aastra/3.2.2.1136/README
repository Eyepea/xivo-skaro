WARNING: Applicable to IP Phone Models 6730i and 6731i only:
The default negotiation setting for the Ethernet ports on the phones is “auto-nego-
tiation”. If you have changed this default setting to another value (i.e., Half Duplex or
Full Duplex), you MUST set the negotiation value back to the default value of “auto-
negotiation” before upgrading to Release 3.2. Failure to do so may cause the phone
to fail to connect to the network. In addition, downgrade will not be possible.
