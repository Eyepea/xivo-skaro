If you have phones using the UNIStim software, there must be in
version 0625C39 or higher. Firmware upgrade from UNIStim to SIP can only
be done via TFTP. That's why this plugin has some support for TFTP.

You might have to set MODE to FORCED in 1220SIP.cfg/1230SIP.cfg if you
want the phone to upgrade its firmware. There's seems to be some mysteries
around why the phones doesn't want to upgrade their firmware sometimes.

There's currently a limitation with SIP NOTIFY 'check-sync', where the user
need to press the key on the phone for this to work.
