If you want to use the configuration file encryption facility of this plugin,
you must have the 'openssl' executable installed on your system.

Note: if your Cisco SPA5XX or SPA30X phones are requesting XMLDefault
files and no spa$PSN files, then it might be that your DHCP server is
not giving them a valid tftp-server-name option (66). You should check
your DHCP configuration before concluding that there's missing files for
the auto-provisioning.
