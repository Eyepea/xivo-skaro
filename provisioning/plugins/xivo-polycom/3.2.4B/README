WARNING: you SHOULD NOT use this plugin if your phones are using BootROM
version 2.5.x or earlier.

WARNING: you SHOULD NOT use this plugin if your VVX1500 phones are not using
SIP Application 3.2.2 or later. See Polycom technical bulletin TB53522 for
more information.

WARNING: you SHOULD NOT use this plugin if your phones are not using the SIP
Application 3.2.4.0267 AND you don't plan on upgrading your phone to this
version.


This plugin is targeting Polycom phones in version 3.2.4.0267, i.e. Polycom
phones using the SIP Application 3.2.4B.

SIP Application 3.2.4.0267 necessitate the following BootROM version:
- 3.2.3B or later for IP320 and IP330
- 4.1.3  or later for IP321 and IP331
- 4.2.0B or later for IP335
- 3.1.3  or later for IP430
- 4.1.2  or later for IP450
- 4.1.0  or later for IP550, IP560 and IP650
- 4.1.1  or later for IP670 and IP6000
- 4.2.2  or later for IP5000 and IP7000

This is why this plugin is also targeting Polycom phones using BootROM in
version 4.2.3.0003, which is the latest BootROM that all the targeted phones
support.

The problem is, it's not possible to upgrade the BootROM from version 2.5.x
or earlier to version 4.2.3.0003.

As for the VVX1500, see Polycom technical bulletin TB53522 for more
information why you SHOULD NOT use this phone in version earlier than
3.2.2 with this plugin.

It's important to only use phones that are using the SIP Application 3.2.4.0267
since the sip.cfg and phone1.cfg configuration file are strongly tied to a
particular version of the SIP application. That's why you should either
download the firmware files of this plugin or you should make sure your phones
are using SIP Application 3.2.4.0267, or you might have incorrect behavior.
