WARNING: These models (at least the C590 on which some tests have been done
here) have a tendency of not working correctly when you do not set a DNS
server. There is no guarantee that the plugin will work in the case no DNS
servers have been set, at least not as of firmware 025.

The solution is to actually not buy these phones when you need reliable
auto-provisioning support (IMO).
